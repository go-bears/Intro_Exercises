# Exercise for APIs / Accessing dictionaries and lists:
# APIs do a lot of work for you, but you ultimately you have to be able to parse the data that the API returns to you into a usable format. Let’s parse the Google maps api to grab longitude and latitude data by city name!


# Starter code:


from urllib2 import urlopen #python library to open website urls
from json import load #python library to handle json objects


def lat_long(location): 
        address=location


#rebuilds apiUrl with new location information
        apiUrl = "http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address="+address+"&sensor=false"


        #open the apiUrl and assign data to variable
        response = urlopen(apiUrl)
            
        #using the the load() method from JSON library to open the JSON file
        json_obj = load(response)
        
        #hint open this link in the web browser to help read the JSON object
        #http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=San%Francisco&sensor=false
        print json_obj
                    
#parse the JSON
        raw_latlong = #find the right combination of dictionary key & list index calls for lat/long data


#parse the lat/long info
        lat = raw_latlong[?] #whats the right dictionary key to call for latitude info?
        lon = raw_latlong[?] #whats the right dictionary key to call for longitude info?
        coord = (lat, lon)
        return coord
        
print lat_long('Mumbai') # output should be (19.0759837, 72.8776559)
print lat_long("Dushanbe")
print lat_long("boston")
print lat_long('san%francisco') #this api link can't have any spaces,replace spaces with '%', can you find a python method that automates this?


# Take it further:
# Play with finding the latitude and longitude of other places.
# can you loop through a list of cities to output a dictionary with the city’s name  as a key, it’s coordinates as a tuple value? cites = [‘Mumbai’, “Dushanbe”, “Boston”, “Antananarivo”, “London”, “Sydney,Australia”’]

# #sample output
# #{‘Mumbai’: (19.0759837, 72.8776559), ###, ###, ###, ###, ### }

# What else  would you like to build with lat/long data?
